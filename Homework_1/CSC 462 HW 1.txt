Problem 1: 
The use of multitasking with one core is to allow apps other than what the user is currently manipulating to perform their required tasks, i.e. play music, keep time, use GPS. These are all things that would lend great utility and appeal to potential users. 
Problem 2: 
The hardware timer is needed to ensure that interrupts occur. This helps to make sure the CPU can get back control if it has given it away and this can also help advance to higher need tasks if a job is not giving back resources in a timely manner. 
Problem 3: 
The first advantage is that it allows for the user to run programs that are larger than physical memory. The second advantage is that virtual memory stores the information in a more representational sense, information that is not used often can be pointed to instead of included. 
p.s. - obviously had difficulty submitting both the program AND the written answers. It only allowed me to submit one or the other so I have chosen to post the written portion here as a comment. Secondly, I am rusty with C++ so the .cpp file works on my computer but I am unsure if it will on yours. I have the .sln the .h and all the other background files on my end in a zipped folder. I will ask at the beginning of class if you want me to send that as well.
